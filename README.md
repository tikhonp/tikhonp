# "Experience"

Director of cross-contextual speech synthesis repurposing as it applies to distributed telepresence, decentralized acoustic feedback loops, and mobile first existential device bonding. Former Lead Maintainer of transitional firmware ambiguity at the Virtual Clinic of Conceptual Health. Vision architect of protocol handshakes between unwilling IoT endpoints and their human co-dependents.

Currently engaged in quantum-level comprehension of Golang pointer philosophy and interpretive C-based memory hallucination. Very low-level.
